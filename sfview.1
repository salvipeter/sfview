.SH NAME
sfview \- surface file viewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sfview
.RI [ OPTION "]\&... " FILE " [" FILE ]\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Loads the file(s) designated in the command line, displaying their
contents in one common window. It recognizes the PTS and RBN file
formats.
.TP
.BI "\-g, \-\-geometry=" WIDTHxHEIGHT
Geometry of the window at startup. 800x600 by default.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print help information and exit.
.TP
.BI "\-q, \-\-quads=" NUMBER
Maximum number of quads in low-density mode. 2500 by default.
.TP
.BI "\-t, \-\-texture\-size=" WIDTHxHEIGHT
Texture size of the curvature maps for B-Spline surfaces.
256x256 by default.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.PP
The view can be manipulated by dragging the mouse
(LMB: rotation, RMB: zoom, MMB: pan).
There are also several keyboard commands for changing the view of one
surface. All of them can be prepended by the number of the surface (1-9),
otherwise they work on the last used surface. A `!' prefix adds 10 to the
surface number, so e.g. surface 23 can be selected by `!!3'.
Setting the active surface to `0' means that the following
command(s) act on every surface - which is the default when the
program starts up. The commands that only apply to B-Spline surfaces
or quadrilateral meshes are marked with [B] and [Q], respectively.
.TP
.B c
Cycles the control net between the modes: None, Lines, Lines&Points,
Borders [B].
.TP
.B g
Changes the visualization of the surface to Gauss map.
.TP
.B h
Shows/hides the surface.
.TP
.B i
Changes the visualization of the surface to isophote map.
.TP
.B k
Changes the visualization of the surface to contour-style multicolor slicing map.
.TP
.B l
Changes the visualization of the surface to slicing map.
.TP
.B m
Changes the visualization of the surface to mean map.
.TP
.B n
Changes the visualization of the surface to no map (only shading).
.TP
.B p
Changes the visualization of the surface to points [Q].
.TP
.B r
Reloads the surface.
.TP
.B w
Changes the visualization of the surface to wireframe [Q].
.TP
.B y
Calculates the high-quality textures for the gauss and mean
maps [B]. The texture size can be set with the
.B \-t
option. The size of low-quality textures is 64x64.
.TP
.B +
Increases the density of the surface's isophote/slicing lines.
.TP
.B -
Decreases the density of the surface's isophote/slicing lines.
.PP
Other useful commands:
.TP
.B d
Toggles high-density view. The surfaces are always displayed in
low-density while moving.
.TP
.B s
Saves the actual view to a file named sfview-<pid>-<#>.png.
.TP
.B q
Quits the program.
