* A better density guess for slicing (NURBS)
* Other input file formats (e.g. STL, IGES)
* Other output file formats (e.g. PNG with transparent background)
* Gauss/mean tuning
- same min/max for multiple surfaces
- show histogram and select min/max
- a reasonable guess
* Lighting problems of mesh files (reversed normals, lack of shadows)
* Slicing map vibrates (?)
* Speedup
